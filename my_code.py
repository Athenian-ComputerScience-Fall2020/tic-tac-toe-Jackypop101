# Collaborators (including web sites where you got help: (enter none if you didn't need help)
#  https://medium.com/byte-tales/the-classic-tic-tac-toe-game-in-python-3-1427c68b8874 I used this website not to directly copy and paste everything down but to take ideas from it and creating my own version of the game. For the first part it is similar because I can not think of a better way to word the functions. 

# A note on style: Dictionaries can be defined before or after functions.


#Defining the Board with keys as TL, TM, TR, ML, MM, MR, BL, BM, BR. T means top, M means mid, B means bot, L means left, R means right. And the values of the keys are blank and will be added on to with either X or O later on. 
theboard = {'TL': ' ' , 'TM': ' ' , 'TR': ' ' ,
            'ML': ' ' , 'MM': ' ' , 'MR': ' ' ,
            'BL': ' ' , 'BM': ' ' , 'BR': ' ' }

#Board printing function, prints out the value of each key which makes it easier to plug a place(for ex. TL) in and put down either X or O later on in the game function. 
#'|' and '-+-+-' are from the readme instructions

def printboard(board):
    print(board['TL'] + '|' + board['TM'] + '|' + board['TR'])
    print('-+-+-')
    print(board['ML'] + '|' + board['MM'] + '|' + board['MR'])
    print('-+-+-')
