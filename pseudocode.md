# Pseudocode for this program
(this can be in a flowchart, using bullet points, inserting a picture, etc)

Below are templates for flowcharts and mardown. feel free to edit them - or delete them and do something else if you prefer.

1) First I will create a dictionary with keys as TL, TM, TR, ML, MM, MR, BL, BM, BR. T means top, M means mid, B means bot, L means left, R means right. And the values for the keys are blank.

2) Then I will create a print board function that prints out the value of each key which makes it easier to plug a place(for ex. TL) in and put down either X or O later on in the game function. here I will use the '|' and '-+-+-' as formatting for the board

3) I will create function ttt as the acual game code.

4) I will probably then use a for loop to ask the players 9 times total where to place their marks. 

5) Using the print board function combined with the dictionary to print out the acual game board everytime before the program ask the user for their input

6) By asking for input from the user of where to place(for ex. TL) we can place either X or O into that slot. I will also use a try and except function to allow the player to redo their input if they typed it wrong.

7) If the slot if already something on that slot, it will ask the user to move their piece elsewhere.

8) I will make a system using a lot of if statements checking if there is 3 of X or O in a row. When there is, it will print the winning side (X or O) won the game.

9) I will also check after 9 round meaning the board is full whether it is a tie or not.

10) Lastly, I will make a function that ask the players if they would like to play again after they either tied or won.
